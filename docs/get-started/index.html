            To help evade detection, Clockwork allows you to use multiple methods that work
            to hide the URL of this Clockwork instance. Click the buttons to use the methods

            <summary>about:blanker</summary>
            <p>
                A standard of disguising, the about:blanker opens a new about:blank window with a iframe containing the
                website. Simple to create, simple to use, and usually quite effective. Requires
                access to bookmarklets, otherwise this will not work.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method is easy to do - just drag the link below to your bookmarks bar. Then, click the new bookmark!
            </p>
            <h4><a href="javascript:alert('It seems that the about:blanker didn\'t load on the website correctly. Go back and try again.')"
                    id="blanker">Clockwork</a></h4>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Save as .html</summary>
            <p>
                A common disguise method, save a file on your Chromebook, then open it. Just an HTML file with an
                iframe. Some schools block this - if it's blocked, try Save as .htm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click the link below to download, then open your Files app (or other file manager.) Go to your downloads folder, then double-click on Clockwork.html.
            </p>
            <h4><a href="javascript:alert('It seems that this didn\'t load on the website correctly. Try reloading the page - if this happens again contact us on the Discord.')"
                    id="file" download="Clockwork.html">Clockwork</a></h4>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Save as .htm</summary>
            <p>
                Just like Save as .html, but with a .htm file type instead. Some schools block this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click the link below to download, then open your Files app (or other file manager.) Go to your downloads folder, then double-click on Clockwork.html.
            </p>
            <h4><a href="javascript:alert('It seems that this didn\'t load on the website correctly. Try reloading the page - if this happens again contact us on the Discord.')"
                    id="file2" download="Clockwork.htm">Clockwork</a></h4>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Direct access</summary>
            <p>
                Gives direct access to the Clockwork OS webpage. Meant for developer use -
                <b>only use this as a last resort or for developer mode!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                This method will very easily let your IT person or teacher block Clockwork.
